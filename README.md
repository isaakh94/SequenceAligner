# SequenceAligner

I apologize for not using Git from the start in this project, but there wouldn't have been many commits either way.

PS: I started to doubt the world around me, but I was right: git is pronounced with a hard G. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git or https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Why_the_.27Git.27_name.3F
But, to each his own.
